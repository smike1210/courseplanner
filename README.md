# Course Run
## [Link to site.](http://course-run.herokuapp.com/)
## Goal
The goal of this project is to be able develop a course explorer that has all the functionality of [UIUC's current course explorer](https://courses.illinois.edu/) while providing many other benefits including:
  * Average GPA of each class (_completed_)
  * Suggestions based on classes taken and classes a user is interested in (_semi-completed_)
  * Travel time to a class, given an address where the user lives and the location of the class (_semi-completed_)

## What's in our project?
  * Uses Node.js for backend.
  * Uses embedded JavaScript files (_.ejs_) files for frontend to enable easy data transfer from backend to frontend
  * Uses previous semesters' GPA dataset [found here](https://github.com/smike1210/datasets).
  * Uses the (Course Explorer API)[https://courses.illinois.edu/cisdocs/explorer] to get the most up to date information.
